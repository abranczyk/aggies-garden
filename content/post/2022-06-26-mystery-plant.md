I haven't been having so much luck in my second garden. The lettuce, Swiss chard and beans are doing ok, but I also planted cucumber, cantelope, zucchini, butternut squash, cauliflower and cabbage, and nothing seems to be sprouting. Then this little guy showed up. At first I was very excited...but it looks suspicious. Not like any veggie seedling I've seen before. I suspect it's a weed but I'll give it a few days.
